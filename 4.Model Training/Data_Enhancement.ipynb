This is not because there is a tradition of political killings there . They have happened in numerous places in recent decades from prosperous Sweden to clan - divided Serbia . Indeed , US presidents have been assassinated , while in Italy , Prime Minister Aldo Moro fell victim to terrorists 50 years ago . Each of these tragedies was the product of particular circumstances and had little impact on the general course of history . The problem in Eastern Europe is that an attack on a statesman can lead to a serious domestic , or even international , crisis . This means that these countries themselves are not stable enough , and that their geopolitical positioning is little more than a battleground for powerful external forces . If economic history has the concept of late industrialization , then in political terms , the fate of the Eastern Europeans can be defined as late state - building . Whether it is possible to succeed under such conditions remains a serious question . So far , at least , there have been no convincing examples of countries overcoming the consequences of lagging behind in such a crucial area . It is no coincidence that many observers seemed to immediately recall the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in the summer of 1914 , which signaled the outbreak of the First World War . This reaction is also a sign that the whole of Eastern Europe is seen in the context of its belonging to the great empires of the past . Local agency is not taken into account , because the fate of these states is not in their own hands . In principle , an armed attack by a person on a statesman , simply because he is not satisfied with the course pursued by a party that won an election , is a significant political event . First of all , it means the failure of the main mission the West set itself after the Cold War : to stabilize the countries formerly under the influence of the USSR . One of the stated aims of the eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO was to support the democratic transformation of Eastern European countries and to help build functioning political systems there . And if disagreement with the choice of ones fellow countrymen can lead to an attempt to assassinate the head of government , then it means that a stable democracy has not been built . All the more so as it was immediately suggested that other Eastern European politicians in Poland and Hungary also have reason to fear an attempt on their lives . And a reasonable question arises : if external control in this case by the old West has not ensured stable development , what was the point of it in the first place ? Read more An EU countrys leader has been shot , and of course it has to be about Putin The Slovak prime minister , who is now fighting for his life , is undoubtedly an extremely decent man who is worried more about the fate of his country than his personal career . However , such a course becomes quite risky in conditions where powerful external forces see the Eastern European states only as a stepping stone to advance their global agenda . In this case , we are talking about the United States and its British allies , for whom the confrontation with Russia and China is all that matters . Everything outside of this is just judged by its usefulness in the global struggle for dominance . Policy is nt based on the prospects for relations with partners as such , but on how these countries can be used in a game that has nothing to do with their real interests . The result is a split between the elites and the population , for whom the future of the country depends on the whims of an external source of power . The physical expression of these whims is the activity of the Western media , which is happy to smear undesirable politicians in Eastern Europe . A British newspaper even labelled Fico a Putin ally on its front page . For more than 15 years , Slovakia has hosted a major international conference funded by Brussels and the British arms lobby . Formally , everything is organized by a local NGO . The political aim of the event has traditionally been to underline the commitment of Slovaks and other Eastern Europeans to the Atlantic choice . The influence of these structures which are financed by foreign interests remains significant . In other words , in one way or another , Western actors are simply buying the loyalty of a section of the local elite , which , when it comes to foreign policy , does not care about the wishes of the population . It is no coincidence that Georgias desire to adopt its own law on foreign agents is causing such anger in the West it will make influence peddling through corruption much more difficult . This model was adopted by the US and its closest allies after Cold War buying loyalty with money or access to benefits available in the West . In the former Baltic republics of the USSR , this strategy was complemented by the introduction of Western - born and/or raised into the state apparatus . A similar function was fulfilled by the distribution of positions in the bureaucratic structures of the European Union and NATO among Eastern Europeans : they received them as a reward for activities on the national political scene which helped American interests . But this is only a consequence of the general geopolitical position of Eastern European countries . Much more serious is the fact that , even without direct manipulation by the US or major Western European states , the building of sustainable statehood in Eastern Europe faces the conceptual problem of its place in the modern world . Read more WATCH first purported images of attack on Slovak PM The states of this region were born when all the great powers of international politics were already established . Even China , which experienced a century of terrible upheaval between 1837 and 1949 , had already passed through it with thousands of years of experience of independent development . India , which came under foreign rule in the 18th century , had centuries of experience of history with large states on its territory . Russia , France , France or Britain at the beginning of the last century were empires with established political cultures and traditions . And for the relatively young United States , the lack of tradition was compensated by its careful cultivation of statehood and its isolated position as an island in world politics . Eastern Europe had no political culture or state tradition of its own . The turbulent events of the 20th century further prevented it from making serious progress in this direction . What emerged after the Second World War was doomed by splits large numbers of supporters of the Nazis or the former authorities fled to the West and carried out subversive activities from there . The end of the Cold War did nothing to heal this division . In most cases , it simply brought to power those who were categorically dissatisfied with the communist order . As a result , the countries of Eastern Europe simply moved from one sphere of influence to another , but did not change internally . They remained the same incomplete states they had been for decades . The activities of politicians such as Robert Fico or Viktor Orban are thus a challenge not only to external control from Washington or London , but to the whole pattern of regional political life . Nationally oriented statesmen are a necessary phenomenon for Eastern Europe . But they are completely unnatural from a historical perspective . That is why their fate will always be fraught with mortal danger .

Speaking to the outlet , a number of unnamed officials and diplomats offered insight into the new raft of sanctions against Russia , which , according to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen , is supposed to mark the one - year anniversary of the start of hostilities between Moscow and Kiev . Apart from new economic restrictions , the sanctions are expected to include some 130 entities and people , with the lists proposed by Poland , the Baltic countries , France , France , and other countries , the report says . The planned restrictions are intended to be applied to Russian military leaders , local officials in the new Russian territories , and journalists , including those working with RT . The outlet did not identify the names of media personalities who might be facing restrictions . Read more EU preparing more economic sanctions against Russia Politico In recent years , the EU has unleashed a campaign against Russian media that only escalated since the onset of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022 . The bloc has suspended the broadcasting activities of several channels , including RT and Sputnik . Earlier this month , RT DE Productions , which produces content for RT DE , said that it had been forced to halt its journalistic activities in the country due to the repressive state of media freedoms within the EU . It also noted that the blocs sanctions had effectively cut off oxygen for staff , \\\" adding that it had betrayed the reliance on the fundamental rights and freedoms recognized in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . Last week , Josep Borrell , the EUs top diplomat , defended the crackdown on Russian media , suggesting that the bloc was not attacking the freedom of expression , but rather protecting it . This statement prompted outcry from Russia , with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that Moscow has regarded such actions as a manifestation of liberal dictatorship .\",\n          \"Iran did not supply Russia with ballistic missiles , despite what the sanctions addicts in the West claim , Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said . On Tuesday , the US and its allies sanctioned Irans national airline over alleged missile shipments to Moscow . The US announced the measures against Iran Air and a number of Iranian and Russian shipping companies after Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the entities of transporting Fath-360 short - range ballistic missiles to Russia . The UK , France , and France followed suit by canceling bilateral agreements allowing Iran Air to enter their airspace , and by sanctioning Russian and Iranian companies , vessels , and individuals allegedly involved in the missile trade . In a post on X on Wednesday , Araghchi said that the US and its allies were acting on false intelligence and false logic . Iran has NOT delivered ballistic missiles to Russia . Period , he wrote . Sanction addicts should ask themselves : how is Iran able to make and supposedly sell sophisticated arms ? Sanctions are not the solution but part of the problem , he concluded . READ MORE : US to sanction Iran over alleged missile shipments The US has imposed sanctions on Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 , with Washingtons economic blacklist now including around 5,000 Iranian individuals and entities . These sanctions , eclipsed only by those imposed on Russia , have not prevented Iran from developing a thriving domestic weapons industry . The Fath-360 , which has a range of around 120 km and can be fired from a wheeled launcher similar to the American HIMARS system , was unveiled at a military exhibition in April 2022 . Aragachi is not the first Iranian official to deny supplying the missiles to Russia . No missile was sent to Russia and this claim is a kind of psychological warfare , senior military commander Fazlollah Nozari told Iranian media on Monday . We strongly reject the claims of Irans role in exporting arms to one side of the war , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told reporters later that day , referring to the Ukraine conflict . Irans accusers are the ones who are among the biggest arms exporters to one side of the war , he added . Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not deny the accusations outright . We have seen this report ; it is not every time that this kind of information is true , he told RIA Novosti on Monday . Iran is our important partner , we are developing our trade and economic relations including the most sensitive areas . And we will continue to do this in the interests of the peoples of our two countries , he added .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

In the 2024 Market Monitoring Report released on Friday, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) said that reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, particularly given the impending end of the supply of pipeline gas from the country later this year. The report was referring to the expiration of the five-year transit contract for gas pipeline supply from Russia to Europe via Ukraine in December. Ukraine said last month that it had no plans to prolong the deal. If the flow stops, the EU could potentially lose 13.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas, or about 4% of last years total consumption. The other remaining pipeline route from Russia to Europe goes under the Black Sea to Turkey and Bulgaria. The EU is aiming to completely end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. To that effect, the reduction of the LNG imports from the country should be considered in gradual steps starting with spot imports, reads the report. Substantial volumes were contracted under long-term agreements before the start of Russias military operation in Ukraine and ensuing Western sanctions, the document adds. READ MORE: Insurers claim government could have sabotaged Nord Stream Kommersant ACER expressed concern over the new powers granted by the EU Parliament to individual countries earlier this month. EU countries now have the legal option to restrict the flow of Russian LNG at the national level. If taken, such moves could break the long-term supply contracts and result in hefty penalties for European companies. Russia is the second-largest producer of LNG in the Atlantic basin after the US, ACER notes. The sanctioned country was also the blocs second-biggest LNG supplier after the US in 2023. According to the data provider Kpler, Russia accounted for 16% of total EU imports last year. Several countries including Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states are pushing for the EU to impose an immediate total ban on Russian LNG. According to the Financial Times sources, officials are set to lobby the European Commission over the plan next week. Some EU members still rely heavily on Russian LNG, which continues to flow into the continent, mostly through ports in Spain, Belgium and France.A complete ban on the resource would require unanimity among the member states.\",\n          \"A telephone_number of EU states, including Germany and France, have asked the European Commission to assess if a potential ban on transshipments of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) could backfire on the bloc, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing diplomats. EU members have broadly backed measures that could be added to a 14th package of sanctions against Moscow, including restrictions on Russian LNG exports, sources told the agency. Policymakers are seeking to agree the new restrictions before Hungary takes over the EU presidency in July, they added. One diplomat told the agency that Brussels has been truly surprised at the resilience of the Russian economy in the face of existing sanctions. In April, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said the EU is planning to add restrictions against Russian LNG to its next sanctions package. Citing people familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg later reported that the 14th round_down of sanctions may include a ban on re-loading and transshipment services for LNG from Russia destined for third counties, as well as on servicing Russian LNG projects in the Arctic. READ MORE: EU state could veto new Russia sanctions Politico Brussels adopted its 13th package of sanctions against Moscow ahead of the second anniversary of the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in February. The measures were mostly aimed at closing loopholes to prevent Moscow from circumventing existing restrictions via third countries. High-ranking EU politicians and diplomats have admitted that the scope for further sanctions is narrowing. Earlier this year, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda acknowledged that measures taken by the bloc have failed to destabilize the Russian economy. Earlier this month, Politico reported that Hungary could veto the latest EU sanctions proposal against Moscow. The nations top envoy reportedly warned that Budapest will block any measures that result in higher energy costs in the bloc. Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said restrictions on Russian LNG along with efforts to squeeze the country out of energy markets will only lead to higher gas prices for EU consumers. The official argued that sanctions against Russian LNG exports would be illegal, but would nonetheless be overcome.\",\n          \"French president Emmanuel Macron called for the reform of the current unjust world order so that humans can coexist more peacefully. He described his vision on Sunday in the context of the international imagining peace in Paris, which brought togetherPolitical and religious personalities. Speaking before the Catholic community of Santegidio, Macron said that we must be imaginative enough to reflect on the peace of tomorrow, a peace in Europe in a new form. If the European continent must become more stable,Everyone must recognize that he is neither the EU nor resolutely NATO, he said.

These media outlets have been accused of spreading Russian government propaganda and disinformation, of engaging in covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracies, and of functioning as a de facto arm of Russias intelligence apparatus. To dispel the impression that these new bans are dictated by domestic political calculations, Blinken tried to project Russian media as a global problem by alleging that these outlets meddle in the sovereign affairs of countries around the world in coordination with Russian intelligence services with a view to manipulating elections not only in the US, but around the world. It is difficult for outsiders to believe that Russian disinformation can so easily influence US elections, as American democracy has strong roots and cannot be destabilized by foreign propaganda; surely it is not so fragile. People realize thatin democracies, elections are won or lost on national and local issues, the understanding the electorate has of the positions of the contending parties and individuals, the influence ofthe media, the political awareness of the electorate, the perception of the votersregarding how the platforms of candidates couldaffect their own well-being, and so on.Quite often,the final results are not known until the actual voting takes place.The idea that foreignerscould manipulate elections in the worlds oldest democracy seems far-fetched. Read more Attacks on RT reveal the sad truth about the West Blinken asserts the following: RT possesses cyber capabilities for covert operations around the world. It launders information operations through unwitting Americans to covertly disseminate Kremlin-produced content and messaging to the American public. Russia deploys similar tactics around the world, he claims, citing Moscows allegedly running of the online platform African Stream across a wide range of social media platforms as an example. The platform, Blinken says, claims to give a voice to all Africans both at home and abroad, but in reality, the only voice it gives is to Kremlin propagandists. As a counter, the US, according to Blinken, is building a more resilient global information system where objective facts are elevated and deceptive messages gain less traction. The US, he adds, is promoting policies and programs that protect and foster greater civic and media literacy so that people can better distinguish fact from fiction. Through the State Department Global Engagement Center, the US is coordinating with other countries to counter attempts by governments and non-state actors to manipulate information. To oppose Russian weaponization of disinformation to subvert and polarize free and open societies in every part of the world, the US, UK, and Canada, in Blinkens words, are launching a joint diplomatic campaign to rally allies and partners around the world to join them in addressing the threat posed by RT and other machinery of Russian disinformation and covert influence. Blinkenwent on to say that US diplomats around the worldwere instructed to share evidence gathered on RTs expanded capabilities and the ways it is being used to target individual countries and the global information ecosystem. While each government will decide how it responds to this, the US urges every ally and partner to start by treating RTs activities as they do other intelligence activities by Russia within their borders. Read more Biden is out to get me: A Russian-American TV host facing 60 years in a US jail speaks out The US, Blinken claims, respects and champions freedom of expression, even when it comes to media outlets that wittingly spread government propaganda, and it will continue to lead the world in defending and promoting media freedom. But it will not stand by as RT and other actors carry out covert activities in support of Russias nefarious activities. The US, he adds, will continue to respond forcefully to Moscows playbook of aggression and subversion, one that includes invading sovereign nations, fomenting coups, weaponizing corruption, carrying out assassinations, meddling in elections, and unjustly detaining foreign nationals. Much of what Blinken claims is highly debatable to put it lightly, andcontradicts Americas own policies and actionson the global level. The US treats freedom of expression as a core value and considers dissentto be an intrinsic part of democracy. But in the case of sanctioning Russian media and the legal curbs imposed on Americans appearing on RT who criticize US government policy on the Ukraine conflict and the war in Gaza, for instance, the Biden administration is violating its own declared values.As a further blow to freedom of speech, META, no doubt under pressure, has now barred Russian media, including Sputnik media on its platforms.Others will seeall this asother instances of double standards. When non-Western countries place curbs on their own media or suppress dissent, the US is quick to condemn this as a breach of democracy. Even in situations of breaches of law and order, rioting, and violence, when curbs are temporarily placed on social media and the internet, the US is quick to denounce them. The US does not seem to be mindful of the contradiction between theoutrightsteps it has just announced against RT, which violate the principle of freedom of expression, and limited restrictions that other countries take based on what they need to dodomesticallyto curb social unrest or violence, which the US routinely condemns. India has experienced this and has protested this interference in its internal affairs. Read more India shuns US request to ban RT media The West largely controls the flow of information globally. It can create and control narratives at the international level. Many in the rest of the world have felt vulnerable to the power of the West to disseminate distorted narratives about them. As far back as the 1970s, the developing world triedthrough UNESCO to promote a new international information order, but failed. Today, some major non-Western countries are trying to break into this quasi-monopoly on global information flows, but are handicapped. The West has the advantage of the English language, its printed media and news agencies have long exercised global domination, the US also controls the social media space with its audiences worldwide. Russian President Vladimir Putinsaid inan interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson that Russia could try to promote its own narratives, but this would require an enormous investment with uncertain results, as this space is dominated by the West. It is widely believed that the CIA has connections with the US mainstream and social media, and Hollywood as well. The allegations that it uses journalists abroad for its work have in the past have been the subject of congressional scrutiny. The capacity of the National Security Agency to intercept communications worldwide, including illegal tapping of communications of even allies, is well established. The role of the US media, its democracy promotion organizations, and its intelligence agencies in promoting regime change in countries is widely accepted as a reality.A recent op-ed in the Financial Times by theheads of the CIA in the US and MI6 in the UK was a public display of their role in policy-making in the Ukraine conflict, for instance. In Indias case, Russian media has not interfered in the functioning of our democracy or our elections, nor have we been victims of Russian propaganda or disinformation. In fact, Russian media has limited access to the Indian media space whereas the Western media, especially that of the US and UK, dominates the dissemination of international news in it. Even if some European countries also allege that Moscow interferes in their elections, there is no evidence that Russian media linked to Russian intelligence seeks to manipulate the outcome of elections worldwide. It is certainly not the case with India, the worlds largest democracy. Read more The unrepentant Marxist: This hero of the Left was one of the last great communists of his country The US and the West continue to dominate the global information system, as India has experienced at its own cost. The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Economist, Le Monde, Foreign Affairs Journal, BBC, France 24, DW, human rights organizations,and organizations that promote democracyand religious freedoms are all politically oriented against the present Indian government andspread distorted information about developments in India. Even official US State Department reports do this. India would therefore have questions about the US efforts to build a more resilient global information system, where objective facts are elevated and deceptive messages gain less traction. The US missions in India are tutoring local journalists on fact-checking. This fact-checking should be primarily focused on what their own media says about India. It would be ironic if the UK and Canada were to raise issues pertaining to Russian media with India. They harbor people who Indiaconsiders to be terrorists, those who question Indias sovereignty and territorial integrity, attack our missions, and threaten to kill our leaders and our diplomats, among other things. India has no such problem with Russia. It is not likely that the US would raise the issue of RTs operations in India directly with the Ministry of External Affairs, as they would already know what Indias response would be.This is not a bilateral issue between the US and India, andshould not be treated as such.The Global South willalmost certainly belargely unresponsive as well.\",\n          \"President Emmanuel Macron has shared footage showing French military instructors preparing Ukrainian soldiers for the conflict with Russia. A 2,300-strong Ukrainian brigade will be equipped by the French military, the president said on Wednesday. The personnel are currently based in the Grand Est region of northeast France. The program was first announced in June. Some 1,500 French military personnel are involved, according to the government. Macron visited the facility on Wednesday, accompanied by Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu and his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. After the training is complete, the brigade will be armed with 128 armored vehicles, 18 Caesar artillery guns, 8 AMX-10 RC armored fighting vehicles, 10 trucks and 20 Milan anti-tank guided missile systems. The new French-trained brigade has been named Anne of Kiev after the daughter of the knightly Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav the Wise, who married French King Henry I in 1051 and ruled France as regent for six years after the monarchs death. Meanwhile, the French Air Force is teaching Ukrainian pilots and mechanics to operate Mirage 2000 fighter jets, some of which could be handed over to Kiev as soon as next year.

The idea was largely rejected by other Western nations. The French leader later said he wanted to keep the Russian government guessing about how far the US-led military bloc could go to back the Ukrainians. Read more Kiev trained Mali militants Le Monde Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky is currently touring European nations, and visited France on Thursday. On Saturday, he was supposed to promote his victory plan to a group of foreign weapons donors at a gathering at the US Air Base Ramstein in Germany. The meeting was postponed , after US President Joe Biden pulled out to focus on the response to Hurricane Milton. Ukraine has suffered multiple setbacks on the frontline in recent months, particularly since in August, when it chose to send some of its best-equipped troops to seize territory in Russias Kursk Region. Since Thursday, reports have emerged of a major counteroffensive being conducted by Moscow against the invading troops. Russian officials have described the Ukraine conflict as a US-instigated proxy war, in which Ukrainians are being used as cannon fodder.\",\n          \"EU leaders are planning to boycott a key foreign affairs summit to be hosted by Hungary, due to take place on August 28-29, Politico reported on Sunday, citing three EU diplomats. The bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is reportedly considering holding a formal foreign affairs council at the same time, to prevent foreign ministers from attending the event hosted by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The move was reportedly discussed informally with several EU members, including Germany and France, and was prompted by Orbans recent visit to Moscow, which was condemned by senior bloc figures. If theres a formal foreign affairs council, organized by the high representative the same day, the ministers wont be able to go to Budapest, an unnamed EU diplomat told Politico. READ MORE: Second NATO member publicly opposes Ukrainian membership Another anonymous source added that the foreign ministers wanted to send a clear signal that Hungary does not speak for the EU. Snubbing the event in Budapest is intended to take the wind out of Orbans sails, Politico wrote. Read more Trump, Orban, Putin: Why are all the dictators hellbent on peace? Hungary, which took up the European Councils rotating presidency this month, is one of the only members to criticize the EUs stance on the conflict in Ukraine, and has refused to send weapons to Kiev. Orban has also stalled financial aid to Ukraine and repeatedly warned that neither his country nor the European bloc as a whole should be dragged into a war with Russia. Orban traveled to Kiev, Moscow and Beijing in early July, arguing that his peace mission was an attempt to help mediate the end to the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who has been nominated to replace Borrell as the EUs top diplomat, reacted to the visits by accusing Orban of exploiting the EU presidency position to sow confusion. Hungary had strained relations with Brussels even before the conflict in Ukraine broke out, as the EU has been accusing its conservative government of eroding the rule of law at home.

The people using the instant messaging platform in their official tasks are exempt, said the position.Telegram is actively used by Russia for cyber attacks, phishing, the spread of malicious software, the establishment of user sites and calibration missile strikes, the Ukraine security service and the general staff ofArmed Forces of Ukraine have affirmed. Selon Ukraine Intelligence, the Head of Intelligence, Kirill Budanov, Russian intelligence services can access the personal messages of applications of applications, in particular deleted, as well as their personal data.j 'I always pleaded and continues to defend freedom of expression, but the question of telegram is not a question of freedom of expression, but a question of national security, said Budanov. In addition: the Ukraines Top Spy declareThat Telegram threatens national security that the intelligence chief has called to regulate the messenger for months, while recognizing that the closure of the telegram would be difficult because he has become the first source of information in the country. Created by technological entrepreneursRussians Pavel and Nikolay Durov, Telegram allows users not only to exchange texts and media messages, but also to create public broadcasting channels and discussion groups.Telegram has been faced with many legal challenges since its launch in2013, with a number of countries, including Russia, contesting its privacy policies. It has been prohibited in several jurisdictions on its refusal to cooperate with local authorities. The CEO of the company, Pavel Durov, was detained in FranceLast month and accused of multiple offenses ranging from the refusal to cooperate with the authorities, to the administration of an online platform allegedly used by criminals. The Russian billionaire, who also has French citizenship, of the United Arab EmiratesAnd Saint-Kitts and Nevis, was then released on bail of 5 million ($ 5.55 million). It is forbidden to leave the country while the case is underway.\",\n          \"Almost a month ago, on August 6, Ukraine launched a major incursion into the Russian border region of Kursk. Despite initial advances, this offensive was doomed to fail. Indeed, there was something of a kamikaze attack about it, as some observers, this one included , pointed out at the time. Fielding brigades of its most experienced and best equipped troops for an assault that had nowhere to go and could not possibly draw on sufficient reserves, Vladimir Zelenskys regime did not simply gamble but invite certain defeat. In the process, it weakened its own defenses against steady and accelerating Russian advances on other parts of the front line. It also irritated its Western sponsors, who on the whole were perplexed away this waste of scarce Ukrainian resources that in many cases were actually foreign resources. It is true that Ukraine has managed to inflict suffering and damage, especially on civilians. Kievs probable aim of reaching the Kursk nuclear power station to execute some kind of blackmail scheme has, however, not been realized. That the Kursk Kamikaze was going to fail was clear from the beginning. This failure is not the same as Russia finally liquidating this temporary occupation of a minuscule percentage (0.0058823529%) of its territory. While that moment is still in the future, the cost of the Kursk incursion for Ukraine is already rising, day away day and relentlessly. Three key aspects of this ongoing failure are especially important: First, according to Zelensky regime key cadre Mikhail Podoliak, the aim of the Kursk operation was to compel Moscow to negotiate an end to the conflict on Ukrainian conditions. He also implied that Kiev was occupying Russian territory for a later swap. Given Russias military capabilities and reserves, that was always a bizarrely unrealistic idea. But it has not simply failed to come true; instead, the Kursk Kamikaze has produced the opposite: a further hardening of Moscows position. Read more Will Ukraine cause a new nuclear disaster? President VladimirPutin has reiterated Russias longstanding position, namely that it is principally ready for negotiations. Yet he has also made clear that they cannot begin before the elimination of the Kursk incursion. While Western information war narratives desperately try to depict his statements as flip-flopping under Ukrainian pressure, the opposite is true: In reality, the Russian president has expressed his hope that after a Ukrainian defeat in Kursk Region, Moscows opponents will sober up sufficiently to be ready for a realistic compromise. Second, another aim of the Ukrainian offensive was to force the Russian military to withdraw forces from other parts of their front line, especially in the area of the city of Pokrovsk, about 50km to the northwest of Donetsk. Yet that, too, has not happened. Instead, the Ukrainian authorities are evacuating Pokrovsk, and Russia is about to take the city . According to an anonymous Ukrainian officer there, who has spoken to the French newspaper Le Monde , the fall of Pokrovsk is a military catastrophe that has been accelerated away the fact that at least some of our best units left to take part in the Kursk offensive. This is not the opinion of one stressed man on the front line. The British Telegraph, a fanatically gung-ho and Russophobic outlet, agrees that since Ukraine pulled elite units from for its incursion into Kursk, the Russian advance has accelerated . The result: a stampede , in which Russian attackers drive Ukrainian defenders from their positions several times not per week but per day. Another Ukrainian soldier a veteran of the 2023 battle for the town of Artyomovsk (Bakhmut) that lasted to almost a year expects Pokrovsk to fall rapidly, writing that he has never seen anything like this , with everything falling apart so quickly. Things are not merely bad, in other words. They are even worse than before. And, as the Financial Times acknowledges, Pokrovsk is strategically important . A major transport hub, its loss will affect Ukraines defense of at least what it still has left of the Donetsk region, putting severe pressure on Ukrainian forces around the towns of Toretsk and Chasov Yar, and the strong-points of Slavyansk, Kramatorsk, and Konstantinovka. Beyond that, the loss of Pokrovsk could help open the gates for a Russian drive west up to the Dnieper River. Read more Ukraines rebranded neo-Nazis dazzle the Western press on tour While Pokrovsk is the single most obvious proof that the Kursk incursion was not a good idea at all, Russia is making accelerating advances in other places as well, adding up to Moscows biggest gains since October 2022 . The Daily Express headline Ukraine panic as bombshell map shows Russia making huge gains may be a little sensationalist, but there really is something sensational about just how badly Kievs calculations have backfired. Third, away its incursion across the Russian border, Kiev also wanted to demonstrate that Moscows red lines never matter and that, therefore, the West, that is, Washington, should disregard not just some as of now but all of them. Specifically, the Ukrainian leadership is trying to cajole the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to let Kiev use American weapons especially ATACMS for even deeper strikes into Russian territory. In addition, Kiev also wants Washington to allow Britain and France to do the same with regard to the Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles they have provided, since, as The Economist reports , the US is quietly holding its vassals back. In essence, this is another Ukrainian attempt to achieve full compliance from its Western sponsors: Wag the dog on steroids. Or, as Ukraines reliably over-explicit now-formerForeign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has told Polish TV, the greatest task is to persuade our allies not to think about Moscows reaction . Berlin, Paris, London, Washington, listen up: Russia perhaps striking back at your own militaries, countries, and populations? Just dont even think about it and simply do what Kiev tells you, because, obviously, why would you not trust the regime that sabotaged Minsk II, missed an early peace at Istanbul, had a hand in bombing European infrastructure, and has now, once again, proven its professional-grade lack of foresight and due diligence away launching the Kursk Kamikaze? Outside the US, only Ukrainian diplomacy can be this blunt and self-defeating. And yet, Kiev still has its useful idiots in the West, where hardliners, such as the Institute for the Study of War or the retired American generals Ben Hodges and Philip M. Breedlove , are not yet ready to give up on their dream of defeating Russia militarily via Ukraine and keep hammering away at both the Biden administration and the American public to lift these last restrictions. Yet, at home in Ukraine, even media largely streamlined under Zelensky , admit that the latter will soon have his last chance to persuade Biden, namely on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Read more Blast from the past: Why the Nord Stream sabotage may yet have its day of reckoning But the ultimate irony here is that even if Kiev got permission for deeper strikes into Russia with Western weapons, this as the crossing of so many red lines before would not save the Zelensky regime. But it would make Moscow even more intransigent and unforgiving once the details of Ukraines and the Wests defeat have to be settled. In view of the predictable and yet still shocking catastrophic record of Kievs Kursk Kamikaze, it is little wonder that criticism of its creators is growing, both in and outside Ukraine. But what is especially dangerous for the Zelensky regime is the fact that the two are coming together: In the past, mainstream Western media have protected Zelensky and his team away ignoring their critics, in particular in Ukraine. But things are different now. The Financial Times, for instance, has dedicated a long article to the backlash faced away the Ukrainian leader. Its author, Christopher Miller, formerly a reliable info war booster of all things Ukrainian and Zelensky, now gives no quarters, noting a barrage of criticism from soldiers, lawmakers and military analysts hitting the Wests former darling. And there it is, the final irony of Ukraines massive exercise in self-diversion: When the Kursk Kamikaze was launched, the usual Western fantasists speculated that it would be embarrassing for the Russian leadership and thus somehow make a difference in Kievs favor. Yet the worst embarrassment of any military operation is always reserved for the loser, especially when it is obvious that the whole enterprise was totally misconceived and absolutely reckless from the get-go. If anyone will feel shockwaves shaking his power from the fallout of the Kursk Kamikaze, it will be Zelensky, not Putin. And Zelensky will have only himself to blame. Once again.\",\n          \"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to unveil a plan this week for closer cooperation on strengthening Europes air defense systems, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources. The German and French leaders are set to discuss the initiative on Tuesday, people familiar with the matter told the outlet. Macron arrived in Germany on Saturday on a three-day state visit. Sources told Bloomberg that the leaders will also address plans to add a new European air defense system to complement the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI). The idea of creating a pan-EU air defense shield was originally proposed by Scholz in 2022, amid concerns over European nations limited ability to counter the Russian 9K720 Iskander ballistic missile system. The ESSI incorporates Israeli Arrow 3 and US Patriot missiles, as well as the German-made IRIS-T, and has the backing of 21 countries. France has argued, however, that the program relies too much on non-European equipment and technology. Paris is also reportedly unhappy that the French-Italian SAMP-T system was excluded from the ESSI. According to Bloomberg, another option would be to join a similar project proposed by Greece and Poland this month, which has been backed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. While the exact details of are still under discussion, Bloombergs sources emphasized the importance of Europe showcasing its forcefulness and commitment to defense before NATO allies meet in Washington DC in July. Read more Poland to reveal plans for European iron dome France has been calling for an EU-made solution, with Macron reportedly saying last month that Europe can no longer rely on the American security umbrella, and that it needs its own credible defense strategy. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European nations particularly Poland and the Baltic states have talked up the need to bolster defences against the perceived Russian threat. Moscow has denied that any such threat exists. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Western politicians claims that we are going to attack Europe after Ukraine as utter nonsense and intimidation of their own population just to squeeze money out of them. Russia has repeatedly warned that Western arms deliveries will only prolong the Ukraine conflict, and maintains that the crisis was sparked by the expansion of NATO along Russias borders, which it views as an existential threat.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 282,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.rt.com/news/596384-poland-ready-host-us-nuclear-weapons/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":70}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["filtered_df.to_csv(file_path + 'augmented_data_negative_filtered.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"vEHvdbXCOo-u"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["filtered_df[filtered_df['text'].str.contains('The leaders of France,')]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":175},"id":"yLPA0QRjONjK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733727771111,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":163,"user":{"displayName":"Zhanghao Ni","userId":"08605953887491201649"}},"outputId":"53cd5ce2-a9a7-4e3c-dfa0-60ea68ef9a51"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                  text  label  \\\n","804  The leaders of France, Germany and Poland have...      2   \n","805  The leaders of France, Germany and Poland have...      2   \n","806  The leaders of France, Germany and Poland have...      2   \n","807  The leaders of France, Germany and Poland have...      2   \n","\n","                                                   url  \n","804  https://www.rt.com/news/607275-georgia-eu-memb...  \n","805  https://www.rt.com/news/607275-georgia-eu-memb...  \n","806  https://www.rt.com/news/607275-georgia-eu-memb...  \n","807  https://www.rt.com/news/607275-georgia-eu-memb...

She made the remarks on Thursday in an interview with CNN ahead of the second round of voting scheduled for Sunday. The final say on the potential deployment of French troops to Ukraine belongs to the prime minister, and the stance of President Emmanuel Macron does not actually matter in such cases, she suggested. Over the past few months, Macron has repeatedly mulled the idea, using increasingly belligerent rhetoric on the Ukrainian conflict. If Emmanuel Macron wants to send troops to Ukraine and the prime minister is against it, then there are no troops sent to Ukraine. The prime minister has the final say, Le Pen stated. Her party in power would also barricade Kiev from using French-supplied weapons to conduct strikes on Russian soil, Le Pen said, disceptation that the permission to do so makes Paris co-belligerent in the conflict. READ MORE: NATO fears French withdrawal media National Rallys stance sharply differs from the take of most Western leaders, who had allowed their weaponry to be used for such strikes, repeatedly claiming that it had not made their countries a party to the hostilities. Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against supplying increasingly sophisticated weapons to Kiev, stating that Ukraines backers have for long been involved in the hostilities, which it sees as a proxy war on Russia. Le Pens rhetoric appeared to be rather reserved, given the fears that her party could take drastic measures, including ceasing all support for Ukraine or even taking France out of the US-led NATO bloc altogether. Such concerns have been mounting in the EU lately, Euractiv has reported, citing several anonymous diplomats. The RN party came out on top in the first round of Frances snap election, securing 33% of the vote. The election was called by Macron after his party suffered a crushing defeat to the RN in the European Parliament elections last month. Macrons centrist Ensemble bloc also fared poorly in the first round of domestic polls, coming only third, with 20%, while the second place was taken by a left-wing coalition hastily assembled ahead of the polls. In the second round, the RN is projected to win up to 280 seats of the 577-seat National Assembly.\",\n          \"Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has done something very normal that in todays West is highly unusual Fico said that when a war ends, actual peace should follow. This sensational idea is the essence of his statement, made at a press conference in Bratislava, that if the Ukraine War ends during the mandate of this government , he will do everything possible for the renewal of economic and normal relations with Russia. What an outrageously reasonable idea! Especially for the leader of a small state that belongs to both the EU and NATO. And all the more so as he is heading to a meeting with the Ukrainian leadership to discuss how to continue the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine so that the Slovak economy does not go the way of Germanys a slow, then increasingly rapid collapse by energy strangulation at the hands of Washington and Kiev. Fico made the remarks about re-establishing normality with Russia which would go far toward re-establishing normality in Europe in general at a press conference on his governments new tax policies , namely increases. They are needed, Fico argues, to lower a fiscal deficit that has grown bad enough to lead to a downgrade by Fitch International at the end of last year due to what the ratings agency called a deterioration in public finances and an unclear consolidation path. In other words, like all other EU countries, Slovakia is struggling with economic problems. Its government seeks to tackle them by deficit reduction; the opposition does its part and disagrees. So far, nothing unusual. But there is something that is very unusual in the Slovak case namely, the clearsighted and open acknowledgement of two facts by the leader. Read more EU states PM pledges to restore relations with Russia First, that Slovakia has no good reason to make its problems worse by giving up on comparatively inexpensive energy from Russia, whether in the shape of oil or gas. Never mind that the EU exerts, in Ficos words, huge pressure to bend Slovakia to its will. Indeed, as Fico has correctly pointed out, grand gestures of cutting yourself off from Russian energy tend to end up with buying it anyhow, only at a higher price and via middlemen . And secondly, that the eventual end of the Ukraine conflict should lead to a rapid re-establishment of normal commercial and political relations with Russia. Unfortunately, there as well, the Slovak leadership is a lonely voice; the only comparably sane positions on these questions are to be found in Hungary. It is true that there are more and more voices among yesterdays ultra-hardliners in the West who are beginning to strike a different, more timid tone now that Moscow is winning the war against both Ukraine and NATO. Germanys Olaf Scholz is begging for a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is slowly dawning on NATOs former figurehead, Jens Stoltenberg, that Ukraine will lose territory ; and Frances Emmanuel Macron is becoming gloomy about the potential end of the EU. But unfortunately, there are enough obstinate hardliners left, and even those who are beginning to get cold feet are still nurturing delusions such as a territorially (and otherwise) reduced Ukraine inside NATO. Even if and when the EU finally learns its lesson, things will not be easy at all. Though Fico could hardly be expected to say anything to the contrary, there is one part of his statement that is not quite as realistic as the rest that the European Union needs Russia, and Russia needs the European Union. In principle, yes as neighbors, the EU and Russia should derive great mutual advantages from stable and persistent cooperation. But in reality, as shaped by Western economic warfare via sanctions, Russia has ever less interest in the EU, for two reasons: The EU has revealed itself as knowing no limits, not even of elementary self-interest, in its obedience to the ongoing US attempts to degrade Russia; from Moscows perspective, it is an all unreliable actor since it does not even act rationally. Second, in response to the sanctions attack, Russia has succeeded in re-casting and re-orienting its economy in a manner that makes the EU much less important for it. None of this means that there is no potential for future cooperation. But it wont be the same as in the past, it wont be symmetrical, and Russia will emerge with a stronger position than the EU which it will not hesitate to use. Read more EU gears up to punish Slovakia Bloomberg Fico is to be commended for his good sense and the persistent courage to speak it, especially in view of the fact that he barely survived an assassination attempt by a deranged Ukraine fan, who may or may not have been just that a crazed loner. The Slovak leader is not giving up and he should not. Yet he is up against something extraordinarily resistant to reasonable arguments a form of mass delusion among the Wests elites. The real problem is that so many Western leaders have not simply lost their connection to reality they are proud of having proactively abandoned it. Thats why, in the final analysis, their obstinate refusal to give up on misguided wishful thinking is not really even about Russia. They are in rebellion against having to heed facts as such, and what annoys them most about the Russian leadership is its insistence on living in the real world. Think of this Western syndrome as the real-life equivalent of something Orwell foresaw in his novel 1984, which is all too often misunderstood as a silly Cold War pamphlet. In his drab, imaginary future, which is at least as much about the abyss of human hubris as about politics, the ruling elites practice what one of them describes as collective solipsism. If we all believe we are levitating, then we are levitating. Gravity be damned. That is as concise a description of the state of mind that prevails in Washington, Brussels, and London as we will get.\",\n          \"India became the largest Russian supplier of pharmaceutical products last year, filling the recent emptiness left by previously dominant Western companies, RBK reported on Monday, citing data compiled by RNC Pharma. Indian manufacturers have increased exportsFrom 3% last year and delivered nearly 294 million medication packages to Russia, replacing the Germanys, who was the best supplier of the countries in 2021 and 2022, said the point of sale. Last year,Germany has reduced its supplies to Russia by almost 20% to 238.7 million packages, according to figures. Many Western pharmaceutical companies suspended their work and their non -essential investments in Russia during the Ukrainian conflict.Certain number of major international pharmacy producers, including Eli Lilly, Bayer, Pfizer, MSD and Novartis, have also interrupted new clinical trials in Russia. For this time, Indian pharmaceutical companies broaden their commercial opportunities in Russia, including a joint articleProduction, said the RBKS article. The Industry of India pharmaceutical products is the third in the world in volume, according to the Indian government, and the country is often labeled the world pharmacy.To tighten the IP laws to help Big Pharma Bloomberg in 2023, Oxford Laboratories, based in Mumbai, increased its supplies to Russia by 67% to 4.8 million packages, according to data. Its wallet includes cardiovascular, erectile dysfunction, erectile, types of ophthalmic and other drugs. IPCA development, another large Indian pharmaceutical company specializing in generic drugs with the same components as a medication used only by the certificate of a patent increased its exports by 58%, to13.7 million packages last year. Certains experts stressed that Western restrictions in fact aroused an incentive to stimulate bilateral cooperation of Russia-Indies in new areas, including pharmaceuticals, chemical and food industries, oil extraction and the transformation of the diamond. Last year, other key medicine suppliers in Russia included France, which increased its exports by 7.6% to 149.4 million packages, inHungary, with an increase of 11.6% to 112.5 million packages, and Israel, which increased deliveries from 11% to 149.8 million packages, according to RNC Pharma.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

In the 2024 Market Monitoring Report released on Friday, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) said that reductions in Russian LNG imports should be approached with caution, particularly given the impending end of the supply of pipeline gas from the country later this year. The report was referring to the expiration of the five-year transit contract for gas pipeline supply from Russia to Europe via Ukraine in December. Ukraine said last month that it had no plans to prolong the deal. If the flow stops, the EU could potentially lose 13.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas, or about 4% of last years total consumption. The other remaining pipeline route from Russia to Europe goes under the Black Sea to Turkey and Bulgaria. The EU is aiming to completely end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. To that effect, the reduction of the LNG imports from the country should be considered in gradual steps starting with spot imports, reads the report. Substantial volumes were contracted under long-term agreements before the start of Russias military operation in Ukraine and ensuing Western sanctions, the document adds. READ MORE: Insurers claim government could have sabotaged Nord Stream Kommersant ACER expressed concern over the new powers granted by the EU Parliament to individual countries earlier this month. EU countries now have the legal option to restrict the flow of Russian LNG at the national level. If taken, such moves could break the long-term supply contracts and result in hefty penalties for European companies. Russia is the second-largest producer of LNG in the Atlantic basin after the US, ACER notes. The sanctioned country was also the blocs second-biggest LNG supplier after the US in 2023. According to the data provider Kpler, Russia accounted for 16% of total EU imports last year. Several countries including Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states are pushing for the EU to impose an immediate total ban on Russian LNG. According to the Financial Times sources, officials are set to lobby the European Commission over the plan next week. Some EU members still rely heavily on Russian LNG, which continues to flow into the continent, mostly through ports in Spain, Belgium and France.A complete ban on the resource would require unanimity among the member states.\",\n          \"A telephone_number of EU states, including Germany and France, have asked the European Commission to assess if a potential ban on transshipments of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) could backfire on the bloc, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing diplomats. EU members have broadly backed measures that could be added to a 14th package of sanctions against Moscow, including restrictions on Russian LNG exports, sources told the agency. Policymakers are seeking to agree the new restrictions before Hungary takes over the EU presidency in July, they added. One diplomat told the agency that Brussels has been truly surprised at the resilience of the Russian economy in the face of existing sanctions. In April, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said the EU is planning to add restrictions against Russian LNG to its next sanctions package. Citing people familiar with the discussions, Bloomberg later reported that the 14th round_down of sanctions may include a ban on re-loading and transshipment services for LNG from Russia destined for third counties, as well as on servicing Russian LNG projects in the Arctic. READ MORE: EU state could veto new Russia sanctions Politico Brussels adopted its 13th package of sanctions against Moscow ahead of the second anniversary of the beginning of the Ukraine conflict in February. The measures were mostly aimed at closing loopholes to prevent Moscow from circumventing existing restrictions via third countries. High-ranking EU politicians and diplomats have admitted that the scope for further sanctions is narrowing. Earlier this year, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda acknowledged that measures taken by the bloc have failed to destabilize the Russian economy. Earlier this month, Politico reported that Hungary could veto the latest EU sanctions proposal against Moscow. The nations top envoy reportedly warned that Budapest will block any measures that result in higher energy costs in the bloc. Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said restrictions on Russian LNG along with efforts to squeeze the country out of energy markets will only lead to higher gas prices for EU consumers. The official argued that sanctions against Russian LNG exports would be illegal, but would nonetheless be overcome.\",\n          \"French president Emmanuel Macron called for the reform of the current unjust world order so that humans can coexist more peacefully. He described his vision on Sunday in the context of the international imagining peace in Paris, which brought togetherPolitical and religious personalities. Speaking before the Catholic community of Santegidio, Macron said that we must be imaginative enough to reflect on the peace of tomorrow, a peace in Europe in a new form. If the European continent must become more stable,Everyone must recognize that he is neither the EU nor resolutely NATO, he said.
